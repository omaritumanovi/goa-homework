    <p>In Microsoft Teams, teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests.

        Teams are made up of two types of channels â€” standard (available and visible to everyone) and private (focused, private conversations with a specific audience). Each channel is built around a topic like "Team Events," a department name, or just for fun. Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, and work on files together.
        
        The tabs at the top of each channel link to your favorite files, apps, and services.</p>
